# ThingsExporter #

This project is a work in progress for exporting ToDos from the Things.app (http://culturedcode.com/things/)
to an xml representation of those todos.
So I can add them to my website periodically and make my things available through the web

This projec will incorporate a bundle of different tools, languages and techniques:
* Python for communication with the Things.app
* Applescript (maybe)
* Java EE 6/7 for exposing Things to the web
* IoC principles
* Code generation (jaxb)
* etc


# Prerequisites for making this script work #
For the python tools we need:

* Python 2.7.x
* the PyObjc package (see install command below)
* Things.app
* A Mac where it all runs on :-)



    sudo pip install pyobjc


For the java applications you may need:

* Java 1.7
* Glassfish 4
* Maven 3.x


# User Stories #

Python Things.app exporter / importer tool:

* (done) As a developer I WANT TO write a Things.app AppleScript API wrapper in Python IN ORDER TO read from todos from Things.app
* (done) As a user I WANT TO be able to export Things.app lists to Xml IN ORDER TO have a usable backup
* (done) As a user I WANT TO be able to import specific Xml to Things.app IN ORDER TO update Things based on external data
* (done) As a user I WANT TO have a contract defined on the Xml IN ORDER TO be use this contract elsewhere (webservice)
* (open) As a developer I WANT TO enhance the Things.app AppleScript API wrapper in Python IN ORDER TO write to Things.app


Java webapplication based on Things exported XML:

* (in progress) As a developer I WANT TO be able generate java code based on the schema IN ORDER TO be able to use it a webapplication
* (open) As a user I WANT TO see the exported **Today** IN ORDER TO view my today todo's anywhere (even on non macs)
* (open) As a user I WANT TO be able to change the status todo's IN ORDER TO be able to provide input for syncing Things.app
* (open) As a user I WANT TO be see the other **Lists** IN ORDER TO view the todos anywhere
* (open) As a user I WANT TO have the same look and feel as Things IN ORDER TO get what I'm used to.
* (open) As a developer I WANT TO be able write to a Xml IN ORDER TO provide data to sync to Things.app
