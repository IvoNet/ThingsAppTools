# ThingsAppTools #

This project is created for making tools go get ToDos to/from the Things.app (http://culturedcode.com/things/)

My Aim is to learn and to do somehting usefull with my trials. I'm a very happy user of the Things.app on my mac and
iPhone, but at my workplace I work on a windows machine and I want to be able to have my todo's available there too.
This project might just make this possible.

See my userstories below for more information...

This projec will incorporate a bundle of different tools, languages and techniques:

* Python for communication with the Things.app
* Applescript (maybe)
* Java EE 6/7 for exposing Things to the web
* IoC principles
* Code generation (jaxb)
* etc


# Prerequisites for making this script work #
For the python tools we need:

* Python 2.7.x
* the PyObjc package (sudo pip install pyobjc)
* Things.app
* A Mac where it all runs on

For the java applications you may need:

* Java 1.7
* Glassfish 4
* Maven 3.x


# User Stories #

Python Things.app exporter / importer tool:

# Help wanted #

If there is someone also interested in working on this project by for example making
the python code better (unit testing?!) or by providing me with a great html/css/js look and
feel for the GUI please feel free to fork this project and start participating!
Or contact me if you have proven to be an active committer.


If the guys from culterdcode are interested in my work and ideas please contact me.
I would love to spar with you guys. As I'm an avid user of your product but I'm missing stuff!
