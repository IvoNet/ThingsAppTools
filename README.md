# ThingsExporter #

This project is a work in progress for exporting ToDos from the Things.app
to an xml representation of those todos.
So I can add them to my website periodically and make my things available through the web


# Prerequisites for making this script work #


    sudo pip install pyobjc


# User Stories #

* As a user I WANT TO be able to export Things.app lists to Xml IN ORDER TO have a usable backup
* As a user I WANT TO be able to import specific Xml to Things.app IN ORDER TO update Things based on external data
* As a user I WANT TO have a contract defined on the Xml IN ORDER TO be use this contract elsewhere (webservice)
* As a hacker I WANT TO write a Things.app AppleScript API wrapper in Python JUST BECAUSE I CAN :-)
